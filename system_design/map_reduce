mapper
reducer
partition and shuffle: After the map tasks have completed, the node may still be performing more map tasks each.
But they also begin exchanging the intermediate outputs from the map tasks to where they are required by reducers.
This process of moving map outputs to the reducers is known as shuffling. A different subset of intermediate key
space is assigned to each reducer node. These subsets(known as partitions) are the inputs to the reduce task.
